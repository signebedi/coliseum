## Saving and Loading Games

Coliseum will save to, and load from, a pickle file if you run the command ```save``` or ```load```. It will only search the current working directory for your save file--so make sure to run the game in the directory with your save file. It only supports a single save.pickle file, meaning that subsequent saves will overwrite past saves.
