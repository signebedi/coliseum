## Overview

Coliseum started as a simple, turn-based role-playing game for the GNU/Linux command line. The point of the game is to enable players to experience a game without too many bells-and-whistles. You have the ability to improve your equipment and skills--both of which are numerically indexed and can be modified by visiting the in-game General Store. YOu can battle random enemies in the Coliseum, or you can join a preconfigured Tournament.
