## Overview

Coliseum started as a simple, turn-based role-playing game for the GNU/Linux command line. The point of the game is to enable players to experience a game without too many bells-and-whistles. You have the ability to improve your equipment and skills--both of which are numerically indexed and can be modified by visiting the in-game General Store. YOu can battle random enemies in the Coliseum, or you can join a preconfigured Tournament.

## Philosophy

This game was written with simplicity in mind. To that effect, we generally worked to standardize various measures of character development along a single, numerical index. This creates a number of (interesting) balancing conundrums that the majority of our minor versions have, and will continue to, address. We also tried to employ limited text coloring to accent the gameplay and give it a vintage feel. Finally, as a couple of lay historians, we added some characters from history to the tournaments that we hope our users will enjoy.
